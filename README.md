Get weather data by using wunderground API

The project uses google places API, plotly.js and wunderground API for searching and displaying the weather conditions of any area from a specified date range.

The user needs to select a place which is already defined or add a place by using Google Places API.
After adding/selecting the place the user can either query on parameters like humidity and temperature and get a detailed graph of these parameters created using plotly.js for a particular date range.
